# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning developed by the Google Brain team. It provides a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers, developers, and data scientists build and deploy machine learning models easily.

Key Features : 


Easy Model Building: Build and train machine learning models using high-level APIs like Keras. TensorFlow makes experimentation easy with eager execution and intuitive APIs.

Scalable and Production-Ready: TensorFlow can be used in production environments, from mobile devices to distributed computing environments. The platform is scalable, allowing training of models on single devices, or deploying models across multiple machines.

Cross-Platform Support: TensorFlow supports various platforms, including desktop, mobile, web, and IoT, with libraries such as TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow.js.

Model Deployment: TensorFlow extends support for deploying machine learning models in production, providing tools for both server-side deployment (TensorFlow Serving) and edge devices (TensorFlow Lite).

Powerful Ecosystem: TensorFlow integrates well with other machine learning and deep learning libraries like NumPy, Keras, and PyTorch. It also supports various hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.

TensorFlow Hub: Share reusable pre-trained models through TensorFlow Hub, or use existing ones to improve your model.

Installation
To install TensorFlow, use the following pip command:

bash

pip install tensorflow
